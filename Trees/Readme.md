Binary Tree Data Structure Definition:
Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. A tree contains nodes and 2 pointers.Each node of a Binary Tree contains the following parts: Data, Pointer to left child and Pointer to right child.

Other Definitions:
Leaf: A node that has no child is known as the leaf node. It is the last node of the tree. There can be multiple leaf nodes in a tree.
Subtree: The subtree of a node is the tree considering that particular node as the root node.
Depth: The depth of the node is the distance from the root node to that particular node.
Height: The height of the node is the distance from that node to the deepest node of that subtree.
Height of tree: The Height of the tree is the maximum height of any node. This is the same as the height of the root node.
Level: A level is the number of parent nodes corresponding to a given node of the tree.

Why to use Tree Data Structure? 
One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy.
Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays). 
Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists). 
Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on the number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.


Important Breath-first traversal: why does not exist a recursive way to do it?
Breadth-first traversal traditionally uses a queue, not a stack. The nature of a queue and a stack are pretty much opposite, so trying to use the call stack (which is a stack, hence the name) as the auxiliary storage (a queue) is pretty much doomed to failure, unless you're doing something stupidly ridiculous with the call stack that you shouldn't be.
